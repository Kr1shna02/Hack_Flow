## User Authentication
+ Open Authentication , just use SSID -WEP
+ Pre-shared Key authentication , Common password- WPA2-personal
+ Centralized Server authentication , Unique password for each users -WPA2-Enterprise

## Wired Equivalent Privacy - WEP

## Security during authentication
+ WPA2 Enterprise utilizes EAP for authentication
+ EAP allows for different methods such as EAP-TLS, EAP-TTLS, PEAP, etc.
+ EAP-TLS and PEAP ensure secure exchange of credentials
+ Authentication server, often a RADIUS server, verifies credentials during the authentication process.
+ WPA3 uses Eliptic Curve Diffieâ€“Hellman for key exchange and Eliptic curve Digital signature algorithm for verification.
